_2019's Newbie Education Changes and Process_

- This was the first year the Director of Newbie Relations position was created and led newbie ed
- I made sure that newbie ed had up to date lessons and material, writing a lot of them myself. -- Effect: not much change actually, I still was missing a lot of material such as PID and Motion Profiling, neither of which I was qualified to cover. At that point I should've gotten someone else that was qualified to do it, but I didn't. I left it to Kevin to take up that task for me. This did make it so that there were no lessons that were taught by the ec.
- Brought back the newbie ed repo, except this time I made sure it was updated with all the lessons, as well as posted extra resources for learning and activites -- Effect: I wasn't very clear about what resources were actually on the repo, nor did I do a good job of encouraging its use. A lot of people were still asking where the slides were located, and I wasn't able to keep its activities diverse enough. In the end, most kids were able to still find resources on their own
- I was the primary teacher for a lot of the lessons -- Effect: I didn't do a very good job keeping order in the classrooms, and sometimes newbies left because I got too caught up answering people's questions that I lost sight of the lesson. I did have the highest amount of newbies stay than in any of the years that I was on the team though, and also had a lot of newbies that were extremely dedicated to learning a lot more about Software Engineeering in general. A lot of the newbies were able to form very close bonds with the oldbies, and with each other.
- Tried to introduce activities that would more directly practice the skills newbies would require in order to work on the robot.
    - Stuyvesant Family Tree(practice using github and branches to work in the same repo as a team, as well as to review object oriented programming, by creating child classes off of a base class) -- Effect: It was a pretty big failure. The base class was full of syntax errors, and the project requirements weren't very well defined.
    - Scanner(Reorganized to stress looking through documentation and relying on that to work on tasks rather than memorization) -- Effect: It ended up being a project that a lot of newbies had fun fooling around with.
    - Rotating Sensor Stations(Learn about the sensors also through practice using them, newbies change the sensor they were working with every day, and rotate in 3 smaller groups so that they can work with each sensor even though we only had one of each, also to practice how to use shuffleboard to display data shown from the robot) -- Effect: It was a very fun project, where newbies were able to get actual experience with the robot. It was very memorable, and it's something that I think we should definitely do again
    - Reprogramming Rafael(get actual experience programming a robot, and all its subsystems -- but not auton because of limitations) --Effect: It was able to work out relatively smoothly. Newbies each divided up into groups, all of which led by a newbie and they all worked together on making
