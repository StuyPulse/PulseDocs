# Newbie Education

_2019's Newbie Education Changes_

This was the first year with DoNR

- Most lessons developed ahead of time
- No auton to develop
- Newbies didn't have chance to contribute b/c no auton
- Newbies again couldn't participate in testing

Conclusions and Future Plans

Usually, whenever we create newbie ed curriculums, we usually try to 
teach the student everything that they need to know in order to do basic 
robot code, ie command based programming, basic autons, and later on, we 
teach them more advanced things like OpenCV, and more recently Motion 
Profiling. Yet, this approach has continually failed, and newbies 
usually end up just learning it themselves. I think that in order to 
remedy this, we should try to encourage newbies to research on their own 
more. I think this will end in more newbies staying, and end with the 
newbies feeling more prepared as a whole. I think we should do this by 
starting them off on big projects early on. I compiled a list of 
reasearch topics in google drive with potential study topics that I 
think newbies should be keeping in mind and working towards.
